Revision history for Perl extension HTML::Tidy.

1.58    Sat May 27 00:03:51 CDT 2017
====================================
No functionality changes.  This just fixes some tests.  This will probably
be the last release that uses the old tidy/tidyp.  There is a new tidy
that supports HTML 5 and I'm going to start working on making HTML::Tidy
use that.

[FIXES]
Failing tests on Windows.  Thanks, Klaus Baldermann. (GH #11, GH #23)

[INTERNALS]
Added more tests.  Thanks, Hunter McMillen.


1.56    Sun Sep 22 16:39:40 CDT 2013
====================================
[ENHANCEMENTS]
webtidy's version statement now shows the version number of the underlying
tidyp library.

[FIXES]
Fixed an undef warning in parse().  Thanks, Vladimir Timofeev.

utf8 was never encoded correctly.  Thanks, Vladimir Timofeev and Alistair
Francis.

The ->parse() method would sometimes return false even though everything
worked fine.  Thanks, @sebaer.



1.54    Fri Sep 17 00:44:36 CDT 2010
====================================
Please note that the bug tracker for HTML::Tidy is now at
http://github.com/petdance/html-tidy.

[FIXES]
Fixed incorrect calls to croak().  Thanks, Steve Grazzini.

[DOCUMENTATION]
Updating all docs referring to libtidyp and Alien::Libtidyp.


1.52    Wed May 12 2010
=======================
First release since the major overhaul that relies on libtidyp.

Now relies on Perl 5.8.  I'm not at all interested in supporting
ancient Perl version.

HTML::Tidy now relies on the libtidyp that Andy Lester maintains
on github.

[ENHANCEMENTS]
Now includes support for TIDY_INFO messages.

Improve support for Windows platforms.

[FIXES]
Fixed a segfault if there are no errors.

Allow for either "tidyp" or "HTML Tidy" as a program name in tests.
